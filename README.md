*Â«Macaron le GloutonÂ»* is the French name of the Cookie Monster, and a
[RFC6265bis](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html)-compliant
cookie jar implementation for PHP HTTP clients.

Currently, the only available integration is for the `symfony/http-client` component.
Integration with other PSR18-compatible clients is planned.

## Installation

```sh
composer require ju1ius/macaron
```


## Basic usage

```php
use ju1ius\Macaron\Bridge\Symfony\MacaronHttpClient;
use Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttpClient;

$macaron = new MacaronHttpClient(HttpClient::create());
$macaron->request('GET', 'https://example.com', [
    'extra' => [
        'cookies' => [
            'foo' => 'bar',
        ]
    ],
]);
