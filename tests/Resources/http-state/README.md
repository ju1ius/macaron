# http-state tests

These test cases are from the [abarth/http-state](https://github.com/abarth/http-state/tree/master/tests/data)
repository, home of the (now obsolete)
[IETF http-state working group](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpstate).

They were carefully updated to match
[RFC6265bis](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html)
(verified using chromium and firefox).
